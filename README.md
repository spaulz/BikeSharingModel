## General Information
- Here we have find out the best feature selection for improving the demand of the biking riding booking
- We have a dataset where we have used multi-linear regression model to find the top features that have corelation with the target variable
- The business problem that this project is trying to solve is how to improve sales depending on the feature selection.
- The dataset contains, 2018-2019 data, month, year, temperature, season humidity etc.

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- The demand is high during the month of September and October of the year. During the end and beginning of year, it is less  
- From the pair plot we can see that Season 3: fall and Season 4: winter registrations were more, 2019 people registered more than in 2018,
- Clear, Few clouds, Partly cloudy, Partly cloudy has more registration
- People register bikes more during weekdays rather than at the weekend
- People report more during the working days, rather than holidays and weekends
