## General Information
- Here we have find out the best feature selection for improving the demand of the biking riding booking
- We have a dataset where we have used multi-linear regression model to find the top features that have corelation with the target variable
- The business problem that this project is trying to solve is how to improve sales depending on the feature selection.
- The dataset contains, 2018-2019 data, month, year, temperature, season humidity etc.
